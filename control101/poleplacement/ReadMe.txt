AppName: Pole Placement
Author: Ruth Bars and Gyula Max, Budapest University of Technology and Economics

Creation Date: 2025

Matlab version used: 2024a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This is a simple interface to help users understand and visualise the automated pole placement approach to P, PI, PD and PID design.
