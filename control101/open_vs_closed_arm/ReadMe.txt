App description:  This resource focuses on open loop control of a mechatronic system,
that is a simple single limb robot arm. It is shown that, in
principle one can determine an input signal to move the arim to a
desirable position. However, computing errors and other uncertainty
will cause the accuracy to be poor, some times leading to failure
of delivery.
